# If using a non-standard socket, HTTP or another location, or if TLS is being used, docker.endpoint must be set.
# If unset, Nomad will attempt to instantiate a Docker client using the DOCKER_HOST environment variable and then fall back to the default listen address for the given operating system.
# The default value works on Unix platforms. If you are using windows, set it to npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine
docker_plugin_endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

# Changing this to false will prevent Nomad from removing images from stopped tasks.

# The delay controls how long Nomad will wait between an image being unused and deleting it.
# If a task is received that uses the same image within the delay, the image will be reused.

# This option can be used to disable Nomad from removing a container when the task exits.
# Under a name conflict, Nomad may still remove the dead container.

# Enables dangling container handling
docker_plugin_dangling_containers_enabled: true
# Only log dangling containers without cleaning them up.
docker_plugin_dangling_containers_dry_run: false
# A time duration that controls interval between Nomad scans for dangling containers.

# Grace period after a container is created during which the GC ignores it.
